# Canary-Web-Dev-Challenge

Hi, my name is Rach√©l and I like web programming and making games. I'm fluent in c++, js, and unity3d's version of c#.

My task was to develop a design mockup (that was provided) in HTML5 & CSS3. I took a mobile first approach, developing the layout using flexbox, a sass preprocessor and some css tricks i've learned over the years. I hope I did well.
